Concepts
1. Keeping the ledger consistent
For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. 
Blockchain is designed to maintain a single truth - "the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect"

2. Double spending problem
Anyone couldnot spend the e-cash again and again. The ledger handles about the assest an entity has.
